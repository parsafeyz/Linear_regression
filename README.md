## 📍 1st Project: Predicting House Prices 🏠

- **Notebook:** `ML 1st proj.ipynb`  
- **Dataset:** `Housing.csv`  
- **Goal:** Predict housing prices based on various features using simple linear regression.  
- **Tech stack:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

### 🚀 Workflow:
- Loaded housing data.
- Visualized data (scatter plots between price vs features).
- Trained a linear regression model.
- Evaluated model using mean absolute error (MAE) and R² score.

### 🔍 Example Insight:
> As sqft increases, price increases linearly, indicating a strong positive correlation.

## 🧱 2nd Project: Concrete Strength Prediction

- **Notebook:** `ML 2nd proj.ipynb`  
- **Dataset:** `Concrete_Data.xls`  
- **Goal:** Use multiple linear regression to predict the compressive strength of concrete.  
- **Features:** Cement, slag, ash, water, superplasticizer, etc.

### 📈 Process:
- Cleaned Excel dataset.
- Performed feature scaling.
- Trained linear model using all 8 features.
- Calculated metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE.

### 🧠 Key Learning:
> Feature importance analysis showed water content had inverse correlation with strength.

## 🧪 Final Project: Advanced Linear Regression Analysis

- **Notebooks:** `final proj v1.ipynb`, `final proj v2.ipynb`  
- **Dataset:** `1632300362534233.csv`  
- **Objective:** Apply linear regression to a more complex dataset (custom, likely domain-specific).

### 📊 Highlights:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on multiple features.
- Trained and compared different regression models.
- Used plots and visualizations to interpret model fit.

### 💡 Final Notes:
> The final version (`v2`) includes improved feature selection and model evaluation.
